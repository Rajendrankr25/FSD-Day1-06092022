Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript;

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object;

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects

Creating a JavaScript Object;

With JavaScript, we can define and create our own objects.

There are different ways to create new objects:

Create a single object, using an object literal.
Create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
Create an object using Object.create().
